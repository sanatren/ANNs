# Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

This is a repository to the study and application of ANNs. The subjects include foundation, algorithms, and practical application and provide the necessary resource in the understanding and utilization of ANNs.

Artificial Neural Networks are the inspiration for the biological neural networks that constitute computational models. They form the basis of modern machine learning, empowering tremendous capabilities in classification, regression, and generative tasks. This repository bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application to make ANNs accessible and actionable.
